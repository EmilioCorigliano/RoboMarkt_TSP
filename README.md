# RoboMarkt_TSP
This project aims at solving the extended project proposed in the FOR (Foundations of Operational Research) course held by Federico Malucelli in the a.y. 2021/22. 
The script solves in a euristic way a more complex version of the TSP, with different combinations of location of markets and multiple suppliers. 
The extended explanation of the problem is written in the "minimart.pdf" file.  All the documentation about the solving workflow is in the "documentation/report.pdf" file.
